# Lab Project: Mastering CLI Commands and Git with Node.js

During this lab project, I focused on enhancing my skills in utilizing Command Line Interface (CLI) commands and Git for efficient file and directory manipulation, version control, and basic Node.js development.

## Description

The lab was structured to provide hands-on exercises aimed at improving proficiency in CLI commands and Git usage, particularly in the context of Node.js development.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **CLI Commands:** I practiced using CLI commands for managing directories and files, which improved my efficiency in navigating and manipulating my project files.
- **Git Operations:** Through various Git exercises, I gained experience in initializing repositories, staging and committing files, creating branches, and cloning repositories from cloud services like GitHub. This enhanced my understanding of version control and collaboration workflows.

## Lab Experience

Throughout the lab, I engaged in activities that allowed me to:

- Configure Git with my user credentials for proper attribution of commits.
- Initialize a new Git repository to start tracking my project.
- Create an initial JavaScript file to serve as the starting point for my project.
- Stage and commit my JavaScript file to the Git repository.
- Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude certain files or directories from being tracked by Git.
- Utilize the `git diff` command to review changes made to my files before committing them.
- Practice using wildcard characters in CLI commands to efficiently manage multiple files.
- Clone an existing repository from a cloud service (e.g., GitHub) to my local machine.
- Create and manage branches to develop features independently and safely.
- Explore and manipulate repository files using advanced CLI and Git commands.

By completing this lab, I gained valuable practical experience in using CLI commands and Git for effective project management and version control, which will significantly benefit my development workflow in future projects.
